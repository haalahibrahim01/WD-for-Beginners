        <h1>Why is there a sudden &lsquo;<em> hype</em>&rsquo; around wellness?</h1>
        <p> 
            Holistic health is an approach to wellness that 
            simultaneously addresses the physical, mental, emotional, 
            social, and spiritual components of health. 
            As a field of practice, holistic medicine draws from many 
            disciplines, religions, and cultures to heal people, 
            communities, and even the environment.
